# Phonepe-pluse-streamlit-front-end

The result of this project will be a live geo visualization dashboard that displays information and insights from the Phonepe pulse Github repository in an interactive and visually appealing manner. I have designed the dashboard to have different dropdown options, allowing users to select various facts and figures to display. To ensure efficient retrieval, I have stored the data in a MySQL database. The dashboard is dynamically updated to reflect the latest data, providing real-time insights. As a user, you can access the dashboard from a web browser and easily navigate through the different visualizations and facts and figures displayed. I have prioritized creating a user-friendly interface that enables seamless exploration of the data. By leveraging the information from the Phonepe pulse Github repository, this dashboard serves as a valuable tool for data analysis and decision-making.
Overall, I have created a comprehensive solution for extracting, transforming, and visualizing data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository. The goal was to provide you with a powerful yet intuitive tool that offers valuable insights and information about the repository's data.
